# NevesenkoVN-hw3

I did this homework based on the HW2. I've implemented all the functional mentioned in the Basic part. 

The blog posts are located in the /story, and registered users can create new ones in /newStory page.

I also could implement the visibility of posts by separating them into two db collections.

I could not add a theme image to the post and deploy my app through the Docker. Sorry :,(
